# Pet Prepared
Pet Prepared is a single page application (SPA) built with React, Javascript, and Tailwind CSS. Its backend uses SQL, Postgres, Rails, and Ruby, as well as Active Storage and AWS. It aims to prepare users in the event of both natural and manmade disasters such as hurricanes, floods, fires, and so on.

## Features
Once visitors sign up or log in, they can access website features and resources meant to be built and saved all in one place. 

The website's features include a place where they can input information about their pets so that in the occurance that they get separated from their animals (eg. if family members, fosters, or the authorities take in their pets), they have critical information at hand. This information would include medical conditions/medication and images to ID their pets and prove ownership. Users can also create a checklist and a contact list for vet assistance or nearby shelters.
