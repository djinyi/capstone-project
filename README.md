# Pet Prepared
Pet Prepared is a single page application (SPA) built with React, Javascript, and Tailwind CSS. Its backend uses SQL, Postgres, Rails, and Ruby, as well as Active Storage and AWS. It aims to prepare users in the event of both natural and manmade disasters such as hurricanes, floods, fires, and so on.

## Features
Once visitors sign up or log in, they can access website features. These website features include a place where they can input information about their pets so that in the occurance that they get separated from their animals (ie. if family members, fosters, or the authorities take in their pets), they have critical information at hand such as medical information and/or images to ID their pets and prove ownership. Included as well is a list of contacts for varying concerns that users can build for contacts such as vet assistance or shelters. Lastly, the website also has a checklist for users so that as much resources can be gathered and accessed all in the same place.
